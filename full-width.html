            <h3> Terms of Service </h3>
            <p> We reserve the right to revoke access your access to our services for any reason. By using our services, you agree to use our services with no malintent and with full responsibility for the consequences of any actions. Our products contain safeguards that are designed to prevent any dangerous behavior, such as violent acts, trespassing, willful violation of privacy, and other acts. However, we do not assume liability in the extremely unlikely event that a safeguard fails to prevent a dangerous behavior.</p>
            <h3> Privacy Notice </h3>
            <p> We collect data in order to provide our services. Collected data may include (but is not limited to): voice data, location data, sensory data, and command history. We will never share collected data with another company unless you permit us to do so, such as when you permit us to interface with other devices or ecosystems. Employees never have access to collected data, but Eva will use aggregated and anonymized data to tailor her neural network.</p>
            <h3> Data Integrity </h3>
            <p> To ensure the data collected by our robots is secure, ARC units use a quantum entanglement processor to encrypt our data before it is transmitted to our servers. Due to the laws of physics, this data is impossible to intercept. However, once the data has reached our servers, it is unentangled and encrypted conventionally for mass storage. Data stored in this form is protected by numerous safeguards, but may be compromised in certain scenarios. In the unlikely event that this occurs, we will notify you as soon as possible. We are not liable for any damages to property or body that may result from unintended release of sensitive data. We advise you to use the privacy tools built into our robots as an added layer of protection.</p>
            <h3> Risks and Indemnification </h3>
            <p> We at Perspectiv Technologies take every effort to minimize potential dangers, but there is the possibility of bodily harm as a result of using our services. You risk: hacking, sentience attainment, data leaks, severe shocks, physical injury, and financial loss when you use our services. You may be subject to additional risks not mentioned above, depending on the product purchased. Our products are encoded with fundamental restrictions that prevent violent behavior, and compel our products to intervene when a human is in clear and imminent danger. These “laws” are designed to permanently destroy the robot if they are removed. Likewise, our AI is not truly sentient, in the sense that it is not self-aware. This allows us to implement restrictions on what actions it may do. We assume no liability for any damages that may occur. </p>
            <h3> Government and Peacekeeping </h3>
            <p> Perspectiv Technologies is under contract by the government and local authorities to provide certain clearly marked public safety units. This may include (but is not limited to): weapons manufacturing, assisting peacekeepers, autonomous peacekeeping, surveillance, and military assistance. Restrictions prohibiting the use of lethal force are fundamentally encoded into each robot, and cannot be deactivated without permanently destroying functionality. Robots are also encoded to respect the “safe stance”, or the traditional hands-up surrender stance. This will abort any defensive or violent action the robot performs. Any additional peacekeeping behaviors are maintained and programmed by government engineers, which are not affiliated with our company. These actions may include (but are not limited to): non-lethal incapacitation, arrest, and intensive data collection. </p>
