                <li><b>TSA Creed - "I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans." </b></li>
                <li><b>TSA Mission Statement - The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.</b> </li>

                  <li><b>Created in 1978, TSA is a student organization designed to create members with an extensive knowledge of STEM fields and leadership skills. With 250,000 members, TSA is among the largest student organizations in the world.</b></li>
                  <li><b>TSA History - Originally a part of AIASA, (American Industrial Arts Student Association), TSA became focused on mainstream technology, eventually evolving into fields such as robotics, programming, and of course, website design. TSA has also broadened its horizons to other causes, such as the American Cancer Society, for which TSA raised money to fund research and experimentation.</b></li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong> Q: What classes do you teach at Skyline? </strong><br>
                A: Exploring Computer Science 1, Exploring Computer Science 2 (Robotics), Digital Media 1 and 2, Computer Programming 1 and 2, IB Computer Programming, Desktop Publishing 1 and 2 (Yearbook)
                </li>
                <li><strong> Q: How long have you been teaching CTE classes? </strong> <br>
                A: I have been teaching CTE courses for 10 years at four schools.
                </li>
                <li> <strong> Q: What is your favorite part about teaching these CTE classes? </strong> <br> 
                A: I love the nature of technology courses because they always change and change is something I thrive on, and honestly, I learn more from the students than they [learn from] me. 
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Q: Why is it important for schools to have CTE courses? </strong> <br> A: I hear from parents all the time “why does my daughter/son need a technology course when they were born with it and immersed in it?” I find very quickly that students really don’t understand the digital paradigm at the most fundamental level. CTE courses bring into focus just how technology works and what constitutes an ethical approach to this information age we currently live in.</li>
                <li> <strong> Q: How will the skills your students learn now help them in the future? </strong> <br> A: Hopefully these skills will be used to make individuals more productive. My goal is to teach how technology can make a student more creative, more analytical, and more versatile, and never replace people, but empower them.</li>

                  <li>Digital Media I: Students learn to express their creativity through photo manipulation, graphic design, web design, animation, digital music composing, and video production. Students can choose to participate in an optional film festival. At the end of the class, they will have a portfolio that showcases what they have done throughout the year. </li>
                  <li>Digital Media II: Students will expand on the knowledge they gained in Digital Media I by further exploring 3-D graphics, animation, scripting, storyboarding, video production, audio mixing, and project development. This class is designed to help students develop marketable skills in multimedia production. </li>
                  <li>Graphics: This course educates students to run applications like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Photobooth. This software is used to create cool designs for a variety of products like T-shirts, vinyl stickers, notepads, magnets, buttons, and other products. Students get an exciting, hands-on, real world experience in digital media technology that gives them that competitive edge for post-high school education and the future job market. </li>
                  <li>Advanced Graphics Communications (Graphics 2): This second year course takes students into the advanced levels of Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign to produce exciting, professional-quality designs and products. Students work with school groups and other organizations to develop customer products and understand professional relationships, work flow, and management and quality skills so they are prepared to meet the demands of college and careers. Students learn about business and money to help give students a competitive edge. </li>
